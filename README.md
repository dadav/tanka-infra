# 🐝 How-To: infrastructure with tanka

I'm using this repository to learn how to use tanka to manage my infrastructure.
I want to create examples for the following scenarios (basic to advanced):

- One cluster, one stage, no CI
- One cluster, two stages, no CI
- Two cluster, two stages, no CI
- Two cluster, two stages, CI

Every scenario will have a branch.
Every branch is based on the previous scenarios branch.

You should [start here](https://github.com/dadav/tanka-infra/tree/start_here).
