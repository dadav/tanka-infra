# 🐝 How-To: infrastructure with tanka

I'm using this repository to learn how to use tanka to manage my infrastructure.
I want to create examples for the following scenarios (basic to advanced):

- One cluster, one stage, no CI
- One cluster, two stages, no CI
- Two cluster, two stages, no CI
- Two cluster, two stages, CI
